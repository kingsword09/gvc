| Platform | Package Manager | Package Name | Installation Command |
|----------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **macOS** | Homebrew | `gvc` | `brew install gvc` |
| **Windows** | Winget | `GVC.GVC` | `winget install GVC.GVC` |

## ⚙️ Winget Configuration Details

Winget uses two separate fields that work together:

- **PackageIdentifier**: `GVC.GVC` (used in installation command)
- **Publisher**: `kingsword09` (displayed to users in the store)

**Why this works:**
- ✅ **Simple install command**: `winget install GVC.GVC` (only 7 characters)
- ✅ **Proper attribution**: Shows "kingsword09" as the publisher
- ✅ **Winget compliance**: Meets all Winget manifest requirements
- ✅ **User-friendly**: Users see the correct developer name

This is the recommended approach for Winget packages - keep the identifier short but show the full publisher name!
